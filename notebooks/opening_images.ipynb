    "# Opening images\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will show you how to access metadata and pixel values of images with QuBaLab.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few classes and functions of the QuBaLab package will be presented in this notebook. To view more details on them, you can go to the documentation at https://qupath.github.io/qubalab-docs/ and type a class/function name in the search bar. You will then see details on the arguments that functions accept.\n",
    "\n",
    "QuBaLab uses the `ImageServer` class to open an image and get its metadata and pixel values. `ImageServer` is an abstract class, so it cannot be directly created. Instead, you have to choose an implementation based on the type of image you want to open:\n",
    "\n",
    "* If you need to open an RGB pyramidal image, you can use an `OpenSlideServer`. This class internally uses [OpenSlide](https://openslide.org/): it can read all resolutions of a large pyramidal image but is only suitable for RGB images.\n",
    "* If you need to open any kind of microscopy image, you can use an `BioIOServer`. This class internally uses [BioIO](https://github.com/bioio-devs/bioio) which is suited for a lot of formats. However, this library does not properly support pyramids, so you might only get the full resolution image when opening a pyramidal image.\n",
    "* If your image has an embedded ICC profile, or if you want to apply a custom ICC Profile to an image, you can use an `IccProfileServer`. This takes another `ImageServer` as a parameter and changes pixels values based on the transforms defined in the ICC profile. You can find more information about ICC profiles on [this link](http://www.andrewjanowczyk.com/application-of-icc-profiles-to-digital-pathology-images/).\n",
    "* If you want to represent objects such as annotations or detections on an image, you can use a `LabeledImageServer`. Pixel values are labels corresponding to image features (such as annotations) present on an image. See the *working_with_objects.ipynb* notebook for more information.\n",
    "* If you want to access an image opened in QuPath, you can use a `QuPathServer`. See the *communicating_with_qupath.ipynb* notebook for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "All these `ImageServer` are used in the same way, only their creation differ. This notebook will show how to create and use these servers."
