    "The [**QuPath Py4J Extension**](https://github.com/qupath/qupath-extension-py4j) is a QuPath extension that helps bring the QuPath and QuBaLab worlds much closer together, thanks to [Py4J](https://www.py4j.org). To begin, you'll need to open QuPath and make sure that this extension is installed. You can install the extension using the QuPath extension manager. Alternatively, you can install the extension by dragging a jar file onto QuPath's main viewer, and then allowing QuPath to copy the jar to its extensions folder. \n",
